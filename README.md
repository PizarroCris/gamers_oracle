# üéÆ Gamer's Oracle

## üåü Project Overview

**Gamer's Oracle** is an Artificial Intelligence assistant specialized and dedicated to the gaming community. It solves the problem of searching through outdated forums and guides by offering real-time tips, strategies, and relevant information about specific games, all within a focused chat environment.

The application allows users to create a dedicated "chat room" for their favorite game, where the AI assistant then becomes an oracle focused solely on that title.

**Target Audience:** Gamers, streamers, and anyone looking for immediate, contextualized assistance regarding their games.

1.  **Custom Game Creation:** Users can register and personalize their own games on the platform, including image uploads (via Cloudinary).
2.  **Contextualized AI Chats:** By creating a chat for a specific game, the AI assistant is programmed to **automatically recognize the game's name**, allowing the user to start asking questions immediately without needing to repeat the title.
3.  **Immediate Assistance (OpenAI Integration):** The core of the application, where the AI (powered by the **OpenAI API**) provides specific tips and answers, functioning as a personalized guide.
4.  **Real-Time Chat (TurboStreams):** Utilization of **TurboStreams and WebSocket** to ensure user messages and AI responses appear instantly, simulating a fluid conversation.
